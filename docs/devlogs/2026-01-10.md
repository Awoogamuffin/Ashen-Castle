### Time for GetMaxSpeed() override

My goal (still not achieved): clamp speed when strafing or backpeddling.

I felt icky about directly setting MaxWalkingSpeed to achieve this, and ChatGPT told me I needed to override GetMaxSpeed() from the CharacterMoveComponent.

It's not possible to create a blueprint from CharacterMoveComponent. So I have to make a BluePrintable c++ class that inherits from it. This was the start of my woes.

### How the hell do I compile?

It took me an embarrassingly long time to realise that the compile button in UE5 is at the bottom right (used to be above the viewport, and chatGPT is stuck in UE4)

### Enough fiddling

I eventually got the class working, but I was programming blind. No linting, no code completion or look up. I wanted to configure VSCode to work properly with unreal.

### the nightmare.

Within unreal you can set your IDE, then have it generate a VSCode project from the Tools menu. Great! but it didn't work.

Twice ChatGPT encouraged me to give up. Then I used Calude within VSCode and it was a drawn-out process.

It's about teaching the linter to understand UE's specific set up for c++, including its macros and whatnot. Something called "clangd" is involved.

Things that I (Claude) did (with degree of confidence):

    - install VSCode extensions Unreal Engine Tools and UE Intellisenses Fix (++)
    - Use clangd instead of C/C++ extension (+++)
    - install NET (--)
    - fully install XCode and fully remove the command line xcode functions (+)
    - Generate compile_commands.json using UE tools: UnrealBuildTool AshenCastleEditor Mac Development -project="AshenCastle.uproject" -compilationdb (++++)
    - lots and lots of generate XCode Project from the uproject (--)
    - lots and lots of reloding VSCode windows.

This process took hours and hours. But somehow, eventually, it worked. I now get code completion and code lookup.

I must have done something wrong for this all to be so difficult... but now I feel more confident working with c++ directly
