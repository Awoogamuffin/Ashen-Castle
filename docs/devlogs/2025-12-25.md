The cursor-facing behaviour was immediate, and to make it more natural, I wanted to limit rotation speed and acceleration. The CursorLook actor got a lot of focus.

Also, I added a LookDirector which will switch between different look actors. This Director will decide the switch between lock-on and look-where-you're-going behaviour

### Interps

I learned about 2 interpolation functions that will certainly be used a lot. R(or F etc.)Intep To and Interp To Constant. The former takes a target state, and the "Interp speed" value defines how quickly it will ease into the target position / rotation etc.

The latter takes a constant acceleration value and adds it the current value as it goes towards the target.

So the first one ensures they reach their target, whereas the second one helps for more physics-based stuff.

The combination that worked for me was to have interp to constant to accelerate into a rotation, then interp to for deceleration once a dead zone (determined based on current rotation speed) is reached.
